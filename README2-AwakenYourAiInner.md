# Awaken Your AI Inner

## First Prompts Example

- Write a Shakespearean Sonnet on Quantum Mechanics
- Now turn this sonnet into a fascinating prompt for ai image software or chatbot

```AI generated prompt
A surreal, poetic universe inspired by a Shakespearean sonnet written in Chinese about quantum mechanics.
Depict two entangled lovers made of light and particles, floating in a cosmic landscape where wave functions swirl like ink in water.
Equations shimmer across a night sky of stars and moonlight, merging ancient Chinese ink-wash aesthetics with Renaissance romanticism.
Their forms blur and reform as if obeying the laws of uncertainty — one moment wave, one moment particle.
Around them, threads of quantum entanglement weave glowing paths through mist and starlight.
The scene radiates soft quantum luminescence, blending science, poetry, and love into one timeless vision.
Mood: ethereal, tender, mysterious, transcendent.
Color palette: indigo, silver, and faint gold tones.
Lighting: gentle quantum glow and diffused moonlight.
Style: cinematic, hyper-detailed, painterly fusion of Chinese ink art and Renaissance oil painting.

## Become a Pattern Detector

How training your brain to recognize hidden **patterns** in everyday life can make you a better **problem solver, communicator, and prompt engineer**.

It starts with examples—like sensing tension in a room—to show that pattern recognition is a natural, subconscious skill. Once you learn to use it intentionally, it enhances awareness and decision-making. **Humor**, for instance, works through predictable structures and surprises; recognizing these helps in both writing jokes and crafting effective prompts.

To develop this skill, you don’t need special tools—just **curiosity and observation**. Study successful examples (like strong AI prompts) to identify recurring elements such as **clarity, specificity, and timing**, then apply them yourself.

The lesson ends with a challenge: spend five minutes observing any environment, find three patterns, and explain how they affect the system as a whole.

**In summary:**
Pattern recognition sharpens perception, strengthens problem-solving, and improves **communication**. You can train it by actively observing structures and behaviors in daily life and learning from them.

## Make a strong prompt (or any clear communication) work systematically

1. **Instructions（指令）** –
   Clearly tell the AI *what to do* and *how to do it*.

   > Example: “Write a 3-paragraph summary using formal tone.”

2. **Hooks（引子）** –
   Provide an engaging or contextual setup that activates creativity or focus.

   > Example: “Imagine you’re a 16th-century astronomer discovering a new planet…”

3. **Constraints（限制條件）** –
   Define boundaries or conditions that guide precision and style.

   > Example: “Use fewer than 150 words; output in JSON format.”

### A Successful Prompt Example

"A brave little knight reading a giant, glowing book to a friendly dragon in a giant, cozy library, soft warm light, style of a Pixar movie. --ar 16:9 --no fighting, scary, dark"

- 1-Instructions: "In a giant, cozy library, soft warm light" sets a clear, happy scene.
- 2-Constraints: "Style of a Pixar movie" defines the look, while "--no fighting, scary, dark" keeps it safe and happy.
- 3-Hook: "Brave knight reading to a dragon" creates a surprising and friendly story.

## Developing an **innovative mindset**

**Creative blocks** happen to everyone—whether you’re planning a project, building a business, or solving a difficult problem. However, ***thinking outside the box*** isn’t about waiting for inspiration to strike; it’s about using **specific strategies** to move beyond conventional ideas.

AI excels at innovation because it **isn’t** limited by assumptions. Humans can do the same by learning to view problems from **new perspectives** and challenging old ways of thinking. As Einstein said, ***“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”***

To truly **innovate**, we must **change the way we think**.
